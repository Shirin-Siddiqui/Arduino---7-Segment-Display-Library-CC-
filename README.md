# Arduino---7-Segment-Display-Library-CC-
Common Cathode 7 Segment Display Library code for Arduino IDE.
This library has a function Seg7(int Number) which takes in an integer parameter value and then displays on the segment display
to initialize the pins see the pinout diagram and make a parameterized constructor with pin number from a-g and dp.
a basic sample code is given in the files reffer to it for confusions.


Make a folder name it as seg7 in C/Users/USER_NAME/Documents/Arduino/Librarys

Paste the .h and .cpp files in that folder and save it on the path given above
open your Arduino IDE and search for the file in the librarys section you will find it there.
